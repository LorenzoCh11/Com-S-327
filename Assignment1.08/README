For this assignment instances were created for each tiem in the item_desc file and instances of monsters were generated from the monster_desc file. In order to place the items in the dungeon, a new terrain was created this terrain was called ter_item. Each terrain of item would place an item that is fromt the item_desc file. To generate the instancees of monsters a method was created that would get the information from the monster_desc file and would create it for the dungeon. In order to place these monsters, the method for placing monsters was adjusted to putting on each of these created monsters.

Lorenzo Chavarria- COMS 327- Assignment 1.03

For this assignment i had two generate two maps that would calculate the distance of each cell  for tunneling and non-tunnelingmonsters. A monster is also to be put in the map and would be shown by char '@'. These maps would then be printed out with the dungeon, a map of non-tunneling mosters, and a map of tunneling monsters. To do this I created two pathways using dijkstras algorithm. In order for me to do this I decided to use the algorithm that the professor used to create corridors that connected rooms, which happened to also be dijkstra. First the method static void dijkstra_pc_tunneling() was called created. This made and printed out the distance of a tunneling monster out. Next the method dijkstra_pc_nontunnel() was created and this made and printed out the distance for a monster that was non-tunneling. To make these two methods, just like the corriders a path comparator was mad and a struct was made for the monster. The method was called static int32_t pc_path_cmp() for the comparator, and the struct was called typedef struct pc_path{}.

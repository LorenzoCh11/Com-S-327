-9/1 : Created the boarder of the game by using. decided to use shruggs
-9/2 : have started creating the rooms using rand, having a bug that doesnt
	allow me to create a room
-9/3 : was able to create the roomm at random places, only bugs were that
	sometimes it didnt print 5 and
that sometimes some of the rooms printed were not a space away from each other
-9/4 : was able to create the rooms at random sizes and random places, was also
able to add the corridors that connected each other, there are no bugs
so far. There is only a slight problem and that is that the board is printed
out at a kind of slow time

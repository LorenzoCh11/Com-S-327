Lorenzo Chavarria- ComS 327- Assignment 1.01

For this assignment, a board that is 80 x 24 generated for a Dungeon game
 using an array made up of structs named square. Each square and has a type
 and a pic which is shown in the board(- and|). The area that is 80 X 21 is
 surrounded by a border that is made with the method fillBoarder(struct square
 array[24][80]). The last 3 rows are left empty for a future assignment. After
 the boarder is filled random rooms(.) are generated using the method 
fillRooms(struct square array[24][80). The method fillRooms generates random 
coordinates and random sizes using random integers, and each room is checked if
 valid(is not overlapping other rooms and is in a valid place) by using the
 method checkSpace(int row, int col, int height, int width). After the rooms 
are added, the corridors(#) are then added. Thise corridors connect every room 
and are added by the fillCorridors(struct square board[24][80]). Each corridor
 is made by the method fillC(struct square board[24][80], int roomNum).

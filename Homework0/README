For this assignment I created a function that would capture every tour made by
 a Knight in a board. The board would be 5 x 5, and each square would be a 
different number starting from 1 and ending at 25. To create the board 2D Array
 was used and each place in the array represented a number just like the board
 did. To get the tour of each of the squares, each square would be put into a 
for loop and would be put through the tour function. The tour function was a
 recursive function that would check every possible move and add it to an 
array called “visited” that would keep track of each move, then after the
 array of the visited squares was full then it would be printed out. This was
 done to each square to find out every tour.

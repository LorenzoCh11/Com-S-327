Assignment1.10 - Lorenzo Chavarria

For this assignment1.10 I descided to make a tic tac toe game. To make this game, I first made a board, and then with ncurses I was able to print out the board each time a player made a move. the game is played by two players, each player presses any number key from 1-9 to place their symbol, they can only place a symbol if that square isnt taken. A player wins if they get three of their symbols in a row, else the game is a tie. The players can also then choose to play again or to quit.
